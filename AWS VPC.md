# 1. AWS VPC & Subnets

> **Goal:** Create a private network in AWS and divide it into subnets for workloads.

---

## What is a VPC?

* A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is your own **private network inside AWS**
* Logical isolation for EC2, databases, load balancers, etc.
* Fully isolated **by default**

---

## Default VPC

* Created **automatically** by AWS
* Uses CIDR like `172.31.0.0/16`
* Includes:

  * Subnets in each Availability Zone
  * Internet Gateway
  * Route table with internet access

**Exam Tip:**
Default VPC = convenient, **not secure by design**

---

## Custom VPC (Recommended)

### Steps to Create a VPC

1. AWS Console → **Networking & Content Delivery → VPC**
2. Click **Create VPC**
3. Enter **Name tag** (e.g., `SALES`)
4. Enter **IPv4 CIDR** (e.g., `10.10.0.0/16`)
5. Leave IPv6 disabled (optional)
6. Set **Tenancy = Default**
7. Click **Create**

---

## CIDR Basics (High Yield)

* IPv4 address = **32 bits**
* `/16` → large network (~65,536 IPs)
* `/24` → smaller network (~256 IPs)

### Private IP Ranges Allowed in VPCs

* `10.0.0.0/8`
* `172.16.0.0/12`
* `192.168.0.0/16`

**Exam Tip:**
Public IP ranges cannot be used as VPC CIDR blocks

---

## VPC Isolation Rule (Very Important)

* **VPCs cannot communicate with each other by default**
* Applies even within the same AWS account

### To Connect VPCs

* VPC Peering
* VPN
* AWS Direct Connect

**Exam Phrase:**
“VPCs are isolated private networks”

---

## Subnets

### What is a Subnet?

* A **subdivision of a VPC**
* Exists in **one Availability Zone only**

---

### Steps to Create a Subnet

1. VPC Console → **Subnets → Create subnet**
2. Select the **VPC**
3. Enter **Subnet name** (e.g., `SALES_SRV`)
4. Choose **Availability Zone**
5. Enter **Subnet CIDR** (must be a subset of VPC CIDR)

   * Example:

     * VPC: `10.10.0.0/16`
     * Subnet: `10.10.10.0/24`
6. Click **Create**

---

## Subnet Rules (Memorize)

* Subnet CIDR **must be within VPC CIDR**
* Subnets **cannot span Availability Zones**
* Smaller CIDR = fewer usable IPs
* `/24` ≈ 254 usable IPs

**Exam Trap:**
A subnet cannot exist in multiple AZs

---

## Current State After These Steps

* VPC created
* Subnet(s) created
* No EC2 instances yet
* No routing or internet access yet

> This is the **network foundation only**

---

## AWS Direct Connect (High-Level)

* Dedicated **private connection** from on-premises → AWS
* Connects via **Virtual Private Gateway (VPG)**
* Used for:

  * Low latency
  * High bandwidth
  * Enterprise-grade reliability

**Exam Tip:**
Direct Connect ≠ Internet-based VPN

---

## Lab Mental Model

```text
VPC = Network
Subnet = Network segment (per AZ)
Routing + Gateways = Traffic control
```

---

## Topics This Will Connect To

* Route Tables
* Internet Gateway vs NAT Gateway
* Public vs Private Subnets
* Security Groups vs NACLs

# 2. AWS VPC DHCP Option Sets

> **Goal:** Control DHCP configuration parameters for instances inside a VPC.

---

## How DHCP Works in AWS VPC

* AWS **automatically handles IP address assignment**
* IP ranges are defined by **subnet CIDR**
* You **do NOT define DHCP IP pools manually** like on-prem

👉 In AWS, you only configure **DHCP options**, not address ranges

---

## What Is a DHCP Option?

* A **DHCP option** is a configuration parameter delivered via DHCP
* Devices receive:

  * IP address (automatic)
  * Subnet mask
  * Default gateway
  * **Additional options** (DNS, domain name, NTP, etc.)

---

## DHCP Option Sets

* A **DHCP Option Set** is a collection of DHCP configuration parameters
* Created separately, then **associated with a VPC**
* A VPC can have **only one DHCP option set at a time**

---

## DHCP Options You Can Configure

1. **Domain Name**

   * Example: `sales.mycompany.local`
2. **Domain Name Servers (DNS)**

   * Example: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)
3. **NTP Servers**

   * Example: `10.10.10.37`
4. **NetBIOS Name Servers** (legacy)
5. **NetBIOS Node Type** (legacy)

📌 You do **not** need to configure all options

---

## Steps to Create a DHCP Option Set

1. Go to **VPC Console**
2. Select **DHCP Option Sets**
3. Click **Create DHCP option set**
4. Enter **Name tag** (e.g., `SALES`)
5. Configure required options:

   * Domain name
   * DNS servers
   * NTP servers (optional)
6. Click **Create**

---

## After Creation

* DHCP option set exists independently
* Must be **associated with a VPC** to take effect
* Applies to **all instances launched in that VPC**
* Existing instances may require **renew/restart** to pick up changes

---

## Key Rules (Exam-Focused)

* Subnet CIDR defines IP range, **not DHCP**
* DHCP Option Sets define **configuration only**
* One DHCP Option Set per VPC
* Multiple option sets may exist, but **only one active per VPC**

---

## Common Exam Traps

* ❌ “Define DHCP IP pool in AWS” → **Wrong**
* ❌ “DHCP configured per subnet” → **Wrong**
* ✅ “DHCP options configured at VPC level” → **Correct**

---

## Lab Mental Model

```text
Subnet = IP range
DHCP Option Set = configuration parameters
VPC = attachment point
```

---

## When You’d Use Multiple DHCP Option Sets

* Different environments (dev / prod)
* Different DNS or NTP requirements
* Multiple VPCs with different policies

---

## What This Connects To Next

* VPC associations
* EC2 instance networking
* Route tables & gateways
* Hybrid networking (VPN / Direct Connect)

# 3. AWS Elastic IPs (EIP)

> **Goal:** Provide a stable public IPv4 address for internet-facing resources in a VPC.

---

## What Is an Elastic IP (EIP)?

* An **Elastic IP** is a **public IPv4 address**
* Allocated from the **AWS region** where your VPC exists
* Used to make instances **reachable from the internet**

---

## Why “Elastic”?

* Can be **re-associated** with another instance
* Useful for:

  * Instance replacement
  * Failover
  * Maintenance without DNS changes

📌 Elastic ≠ temporary

---

## Key Characteristics (High Yield)

* **Public IP** (not private ranges like `10.x`, `172.16–31.x`, `192.168.x`)
* **Allocated to your AWS account**
* **Remains allocated until released**
* **Charged while allocated**, even if unused

---

## Cost Rule (Very Important)

* You are **charged for an EIP when it is not associated**
* Unused EIPs = **wasted money**

**Exam Tip:**
AWS charges to discourage public IPv4 hoarding

---

## How EIPs Are Used

* EIPs are **associated with an Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**
* ENI attaches to:

  * EC2 instance
  * Other supported services

```text
EIP → ENI → EC2 Instance
```

---

## Region Limitation

* EIPs are **region-specific**
* Can be moved:

  * Between instances
  * **Only within the same region**

❌ Cannot move an EIP across regions

---

## When You Need an EIP

* Internet-facing servers
* Static public IP requirement
* Legacy apps needing fixed IPs
* External systems whitelisting IPs

---

## Steps to Allocate an Elastic IP

1. Go to **VPC Console**
2. Select **Elastic IPs**
3. Click **Allocate Elastic IP address**
4. Choose:

   * **Amazon pool** (most common)
   * Or **Customer-owned IP**
5. Click **Allocate**

---

## After Allocation

* EIP is:

  * Assigned to your account
  * **Not attached to anything yet**
* Starts **incurring cost if unused**

---

## Associate an Elastic IP

* Associate EIP with:

  * An **ENI**
  * Or directly to an **EC2 instance**
* This enables **public internet access**

---

## How to Release an Elastic IP

1. Ensure it is **not associated** with any instance
2. Select the EIP
3. **Actions → Release Elastic IP addresses**
4. Confirm release

📌 Always verify before releasing

---

## Common Exam Traps

* ❌ “EIPs are free” → **Wrong**
* ❌ “EIPs are private IPs” → **Wrong**
* ❌ “EIPs can move across regions” → **Wrong**
* ✅ “Charged when allocated and unused” → **Correct**

---

## Lab Mental Model

```text
Private IP → internal communication
Public IP / EIP → internet access
EIP = stable public identity
```

---

## What This Connects To Next

* Internet Gateways
* Route Tables
* Public vs Private Subnets
* NAT Gateway vs EIP usage

---

# 4. Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)

## What Is an Elastic Network Interface (ENI)?
An **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)** is:
- A **virtual network interface**
- Attached to an **EC2 instance**
- Comparable to a **physical network card** in a real server

### Physical vs Cloud Analogy
| Physical World | AWS Cloud |
|---------------|-----------|
| Physical server | EC2 instance |
| Network Interface Card (NIC) | Elastic Network Interface (ENI) |
| Plug in another NIC for more connectivity | Attach another ENI |

---

## Scope and Placement
An ENI:
- Exists **only within a VPC**
- Is **associated with a subnet**
- Is **attached to an EC2 instance**
- All components (VPC, subnet, ENI, instance) live within the same VPC

---

## Why Use an ENI?

### Dual-Homing
The primary benefit of ENIs is **dual-homing**.

**Dual-homed device**:
- A device connected to **multiple networks**
- Has more than one “home”

Examples:
- **Internet router**  
  - One interface to the internet  
  - One interface to a private network
- **Firewall**  
  - One interface on an untrusted network  
  - One interface on a trusted network

---

## Dual-Homing with ENIs
By attaching:
- **One ENI** → one network
- **Multiple ENIs** → multiple networks

You can:
- Connect an instance to **multiple subnets**
- Separate **public-facing** and **private** traffic
- Assign:
  - A **public IP** to one ENI
  - **Private IPs** to others

This allows:
- Internet access on one interface
- Internal VPC or subnet access on another

---

## Mental Model: ENI as a Virtual Network Card
Think of an ENI as:

1. A **virtual network card sitting on a shelf**
2. You **create it independently**
3. You **attach it to an instance**
4. Once attached, you:
   - Assign IP addresses
   - Choose the subnet
   - Enable public or private connectivity

After attachment:
- The instance is now connected to an **additional network**
- The ENI itself remains just a **virtual NIC**

---

## Summary
- **ENI = virtual network card**
- Exists within a **VPC**
- Associated with a **subnet**
- Attached to an **EC2 instance**
- Enables **dual-homing** and multi-network connectivity
- Key to advanced networking designs (firewalls, routing, segmentation)

---

# 5. VPC Endpoints (Deep Dive)

## What Is an Endpoint in AWS?
In AWS, an **endpoint** is:
- A **connection** that allows a **VPC to access AWS-managed services**
- Examples: **Amazon S3**, **Glacier**, analytics services, etc.

Key clarification:
- An AWS endpoint is **NOT** a physical device at the end of a network link.
- Think of it as a **bridge or connection point** from your **VPC** to **AWS services that live outside the VPC**.

---

## Why Endpoints Matter
Endpoints allow you to:
- Access AWS services **without leaving the AWS network**
- Enforce **fine-grained access control** using endpoint policies
- Restrict:
  - Which services are reachable
  - Who can access those services
  - What actions they can perform

Different endpoints can:
- Connect to different services
- Use different policies
- Be controlled independently

---

## Mental Model
- Your **instances live inside a VPC**
- Many AWS services (S3, Glacier, analytics services) live **outside the VPC**
- To connect the two securely, you create a **VPC Endpoint**
- The endpoint acts like a **controlled bridge** between them

---

## Information Required to Create an Endpoint
To create a VPC endpoint, you must specify:

1. **VPC**
   - The VPC where the endpoint will live

2. **Service Name**
   - Defined using DNS format:
     ```
     com.amazonaws.<region>.<service>
     ```
   - Example:
     ```
     com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3
     ```

3. **Endpoint Policy**
   - Controls:
     - Who (Principal)
     - Can do what (Actions)
     - On which resources (Resources)

4. **Route Tables**
   - Defines how traffic is routed from the subnet to the AWS service
   - The endpoint automatically inserts the required route entries

---

## Endpoint Creation Process (Console Walkthrough)

### Step 1: Open VPC Console
- Go to **VPC Management Console**
- Open the **VPC Dashboard**
- Select **Endpoints**

---

### Step 2: Create Endpoint
- Click **Create Endpoint**
- By default, there are no endpoints unless previously created

---

### Step 3: Choose Service
You can:
- Select **AWS services**
- Search by service name
- Choose services from **AWS Marketplace**

Example:
- Select **Amazon S3**
- This creates a bridge from the VPC to S3

---

### Step 4: Choose the VPC
- Select the target VPC (e.g., `SALES VPC`)
- The endpoint will exist inside this VPC

---

### Step 5: Configure Route Tables
- AWS automatically adds a route like:
- You simply:
- Select the appropriate **route table**
- Important:
- If you have multiple route tables, ensure you choose the correct one
- This determines which subnets can reach the service

---

### Step 6: Configure Endpoint Policy
Options:
- **Full Access (default)**
- **Custom Policy**

#### Full Access
- Allows all users in the VPC full access to the service

#### Custom Policy
- Uses the **Policy Generator**
- Define:
- Service
- Principals
- Allowed actions
- Same structure as IAM policies, but scoped to the endpoint

For this example:
- Leave policy as **Full Access**

---

### Step 7: Create Endpoint
- Click **Create Endpoint**
- Endpoint enters creation process
- Status changes to **Available**

---

## Viewing the Created Endpoint
Once created, you can see:
- **Endpoint ID**
- **Service Name** (e.g., S3)
- **Endpoint Type** (e.g., Gateway)
- **VPC ID**
- **Associated Route Tables**
- **Endpoint Policy**

---

## Understanding the Endpoint Policy
Example policy structure:
```json
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": "*",
"Action": "*",
"Resource": "*"
}
```

---

# 6. VPC Peering (Concepts & Fundamentals)

## What Is VPC Peering?
**VPC Peering** is a way to **connect one Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to another** so that resources in each VPC can communicate with each other.

By default:
- **VPCs cannot communicate with other VPCs**
- A connection must be explicitly created

Example use cases:
- SALES VPC ↔ MARKETING VPC
- Management VPC ↔ Production VPC
- Development VPC ↔ Production VPC
- Corporate VPC ↔ Partner VPC

---

## Real-World Analogy
Think of VPC Peering like:
- Building a **WAN connection** between two company networks

In the physical world:
- Two companies merge
- Each has its own network
- A WAN link is created so they can collaborate

In AWS:
- Each company network = a VPC
- WAN link = **VPC Peering connection**

---

## Key Characteristics of VPC Peering

### 1. One VPC Connects Directly to Another
- Peering is a **direct, one-to-one relationship**
- It simply means:  
  **VPC A ↔ VPC B**

---

### 2. VPC Peering Is NOT Transitive (Very Important)
Peering connections **do not pass through other VPCs**.

Example:
- SALES VPC is peered with VPC 2
- VPC 2 is peered with MARKETING VPC

❌ This does **NOT** mean:
- SALES can communicate with MARKETING

✅ For SALES and MARKETING to communicate:
- They must be **directly peered**

Rule:

Every VPC pair that needs communication must have its **own peering connection**.

---

## Common Peering Scenarios
- Management VPC ↔ Production VPC
- Development VPC ↔ Production VPC
- Corporate VPC ↔ Partner VPC

If *everyone* must talk to *everyone*:
- Each VPC must be **explicitly peered** with the others

---

## How VPC Peering Is Created (High-Level Process)

### 1. Initiator and Receiver
- One VPC **initiates** the peering request
- The other VPC **receives** and **accepts** it
- Either VPC can be the initiator

Important:
- **Only the VPC owner can initiate or accept peering**
- An admin alone is not sufficient—it must be the owner

---

### 2. CIDR Blocks Must NOT Overlap
- The IP address ranges (CIDR blocks) of the two VPCs:
  - **Must be unique**
  - **Cannot overlap**

Why?
- Routing would be impossible if both VPCs use the same IP ranges

Best practice:
- **Never reuse the same CIDR block across VPCs**
- Each VPC should have its own unique IP range

Tip:
- Track VPC CIDR blocks in a spreadsheet if you manage many VPCs

---

### 3. Peering Request Acceptance
- Initiator sends the peering request
- Receiver accepts the request
- Acceptance must also be done by the **VPC owner**

---

### 4. Route Tables Must Be Updated
- Each VPC needs:
  - A route that points to the **peering connection**
- Peering alone is not enough

Analogy:
- A WAN link exists, but traffic still needs a **route** to use it

---

### 5. Security Group Rules May Need Changes
- AWS Security Groups act like **instance-level firewalls**
- You may need to:
  - Allow inbound traffic from the peer VPC
  - Allow outbound traffic to the peer VPC

Without proper rules:
- Traffic will still be blocked, even if peering exists

---

## Key Takeaways
- VPC Peering connects **one VPC directly to another**
- It is similar to a **WAN connection**
- **Peering is NOT transitive**
- CIDR blocks **must not overlap**
- Routes and security group rules **must be configured**
- Every VPC pair that needs communication must be **explicitly peered**

If you keep these principles in mind, you’ll avoid the most common VPC peering mistakes.

---

# 7. Creating a VPC Peering Connection (Step-by-Step)

## High-Level Process
Creating a VPC peering connection involves three main steps:
1. Ensure **both VPCs exist** and have **non-overlapping CIDR blocks**
2. **Send a peering request** from one VPC (initiator)
3. **Accept the request** from the other VPC (acceptor)

After peering is established:
- **Route tables must be updated** on both sides for traffic to flow

---

## Example Setup
- **Marketing VPC**: `10.11.0.0/16`
- **Sales VPC**: `10.10.0.0/16`

CIDR blocks are different → peering is allowed.

---

## Step 1: Create the Peering Request
1. Open **VPC Dashboard**
2. Go to **Peering Connections**
3. Click **Create Peering Connection**
4. Enter a name (e.g., `marketing-sales`)
5. Select the **Requestor VPC** (initiator): `Marketing`
6. Select the **Acceptor VPC**: `Sales`
7. Create the peering connection

Result:
- Status shows **Pending Acceptance**

> Note: Only the **VPC owner** can initiate and accept peering requests.

---

## Step 2: Accept the Peering Request
1. Select the peering connection
2. Go to **Actions → Accept Request**
3. Confirm acceptance

Result:
- Peering status becomes **Active**

⚠️ At this point, traffic still will **not** flow.

---

## Step 3: Update Route Tables (Critical Step)

### Why This Is Needed
Peering is like a **WAN link**:
- The link can exist
- But without routes, no traffic uses it

---

### Add Route in Sales VPC
- Destination: `10.11.0.0/16` (Marketing VPC)
- Target: `marketing-sales` peering connection
- Save the route

---

### Add Route in Marketing VPC
- Destination: `10.10.0.0/16` (Sales VPC)
- Target: `marketing-sales` peering connection
- Save the route

Now:
- Traffic from each VPC knows how to reach the other

---

## Key Takeaways
- Peering request → acceptance → routing
- **Peering alone is not enough**
- Routes must exist in **both VPCs**
- Think of the peering connection as a **network interface/WAN link**
- For *N* VPCs to fully communicate, you need:


This can quickly become complex to manage.

---

## Alternative: VPC Sharing
AWS now allows:
- **Sharing a VPC across accounts** within an AWS Organization

Benefits:
- Avoids managing many peering connections
- Simpler architecture for multi-account setups

Peering still works—but **VPC sharing is often the cleaner solution**.

---
